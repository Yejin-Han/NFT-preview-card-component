## My process

### Built with

- [BEM](https://getbem.com/) - Block Element Modifier
- [SCSS](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

- simple SCSS grammar
- how to use BEM with SCSS

### Continued development

- I spent almost 3 hours to finish this solution. I always put too much strength on some details while building responsive designs. I have to make it faster.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://mingmeng030.tistory.com/252) - I learned that in SCSS we can use hex code in rgba.
